<p>Make a realistic ball bounce around the screen in a designed setting (look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4&amp;t=254s">staging</a> in the 12 principles of animation). The ball should pretend to exist somewhat as a real object and use the sides of the frame as walls. The ball should bounce or interact with one of those walls at least once. Motions and physics can be exaggerated.</p>
