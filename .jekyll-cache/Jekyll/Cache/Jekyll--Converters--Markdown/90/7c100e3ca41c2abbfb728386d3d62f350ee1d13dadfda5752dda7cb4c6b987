<h3 id="materials">materials</h3>
<p>Not many necessary materials for this course but there are a few. (Items in parenthesis are what I use)</p>
<ol>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This course consists of exercises, projects, workshops, readings, discussions, and critiques. The exercises are to begin to familiarize students with specific concepts and ideas and the projects are a synthesis of the concepts and ideas we will cover. Readings and discussions will be centered around contemporary poster design.</p>

<h4 id="poster-1-type-only">poster 1: type only</h4>
<p>An investigation into typography as a means of communication and as a formal element in design. The base of the project will be choosing a character to physically construct, then documenting that character through photography and then integrating that image into a poster. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="poster-2-content-follows-form">poster 2: content follows form</h4>
<p>Many times the content of a design drives the form but what happens the content is decided based on the form? This poster will start with formal studies using collage and abstract photography and then integrate content. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="poster-3-for-an-exhibition">poster 3: for an exhibition</h4>
<p>The final poster will be for a a fictional exhibition of work. A list of artists will be provided to choose from and the only design restriction is that images of the artist or the artists work cannot be used. Details and information that must be included on the poster will also be provided. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>This course has an engagement policy instead of an attendance policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend class meetings</li>
  <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
  <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
  <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
  <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
  <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
  <li>Care about yourself &amp; your work, your classmates &amp; their work, and this class.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on engagement (25%),  exercises (25%), and projects (50%).</p>

<h4 id="engagement-25">engagement (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on previous pages but will include attendance, discussion assignments, critiques, and overall participation. Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.</p>

<h3 id="exercises-25">exercises (25%)</h3>
<p>The exercises are graded using basic rubrics shown below. The rubric includes your ability to follow the instructions of the exercise and your ability to submit it on time. The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and knowledge design.</p>

<h3 id="projects--40">projects  (40%)</h3>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your ability to submit the required, weekly checkpoints for the project. These weekly checkpoints use a simple rubric based on your effort, timeliness, improvement, and completion. The second grade will be based on the final project you submit and has a more extensive rubric. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 40%.</p>

<h3 id="rubrics">rubrics</h3>
<p>Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are available in the PDF syllabus and on project sheets.</p>

<h3 id="communication">communication</h3>
<p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work it will be of best interest to you and your grade to communicate those things to me in advance. I do not need know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.</p>

<p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-schedule">Weekly Schedule</h3>
<p>Class is on Thursdays from 1:30–4:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>

<p>A note—Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked in all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and, especially now, making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>

<p>A second note—Printing doesn’t happen in five minutes. In order to be prepared for class you will most likely need to print things the day before. Sending something to print an hour before class will most likely result in you not being prepared for class because the print isn’t ready to pick up or because you don’t have time to trim, glue, tape, etc.</p>

<h3 id="semester-schedule">Semester Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this fall. It is subject to additions and subtractions.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-meeting-guide">Virtual Meeting Guide</h3>

<p>A few points to guide our virtual meetings. These are not demands but a guide to help us have a more engaging and productive meeting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Treat this as much like coming to class on campus as you can.</li>
  <li>Join early. We are most likely at home so you shouldn’t have any extra traffic, long lines at the coffee shop, etc. Joining early will also help you work out any technical issues you might be experiencing with audio and/or video.</li>
  <li>Mute yourself upon entering the room unless, of course, you are talking. Remember when you start to talk to unmute yourself. Different platforms have different methods for muting and unmuting but it is typically easy to find in the main set of buttons in the bottom middle of the window.</li>
  <li>Have your video turned on with you in the frame. It is nice to see faces in a time where we do not get to see a lot of faces. Having your video on also helps you stay focused and engaged.</li>
  <li>Wear clothes appropriate for a meeting with me and with your classmates. Again, treat this like you were coming to class physically.</li>
  <li>Headphones with a microphone can make it easier to hear others and for us to hear you.</li>
  <li>Try to be in a well lit space.</li>
  <li>Find a quiet place to join the meeting. I understand we might be sharing the space with others but try to find a space that is away from distractions and other interruptions.</li>
  <li>If you live with roommates or family, make sure they know that you will be in an online session and that you should not be interrupted.</li>
  <li>Feel free to use the chat but keep it relevant to what we are discussing.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the meeting. Avoid multitasking.</li>
  <li>If you have a question or something to say, use the raise hand option and I’ll call on you. This will help us avoid talking over each other and make sure everyone gets to say what they want to say. You can also type your question in the chat.</li>
  <li>If your internet connection drops, re-join the session using the same link.</li>
  <li>Online meetings can sometimes be frustrating. If you encounter technical problems, try to stay calm. Don’t panic. We are all trying to do this together and we understand that sometimes it can be difficult to connect online. Don’t give up and keep trying. Use the chat window to communicate.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>You must be virtually, mentally, and verbally present and prepared. Punctuality is of prime importance. Since getting to class consists of sitting in front of a computer, there are few good excuses for being late to class, try and be as early as you can. Being early will help work through any technology issues that might come up. Tardiness will also affect your final grade—three late arrivals equals an absence. Please come to class prepared and ready to work for the entire scheduled time. Being prepared includes having all work uploaded and ready to discuss.</p>

<p>You are expected to attend all meetings of the class. I understand that sometimes issues arise that prevent you from making it to class. It is your responsibility to let me know that you will be missing class and to talk to a classmate to go over what you missed. You cannot participate if you are not in class. Attendance is 10% of your grade and will be calculated by your presence in the virtual sessions. Again, attendance and participation in class are extremely important.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-of-work">Discussion of Work</h3>
<p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and type about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills too.</p>

<h3 id="grading-1">Grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on your attendance and quizzes (10%), participation (25%),  exercises (25%), and projects (40%).</p>

<h4 id="attendance-and-quizzes-10">Attendance and quizzes (10%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be an average between your total quiz grade and your total attendance. If you show up to class and do well on the quizzes you will be fine.</p>

<h4 id="participation-25">Participation (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will primarily be based on discussion board assignments and critiques with a smaller portion based on participation in our virtual channels (Slack and Zoom). As long as you are engaged in those channels throughout the semester you will be fine here. A note about this grade in Blackboard — the grade will start as a 100 and you will lose points for not participating. For example, if you are supposed to give feedback to a classmate by a certain day and you do not give that feedback you will lose points from the participation grade. There is no way to make up these points.</p>

<h4 id="exercises-25-1">Exercises (25%)</h4>
<p>The exercises are graded using a basic rubric that looks at your ability to submit the exercise on time, to follow the requirements of the exercise, the overall design of the exercise, and the motion of the exercise. The exercise are meant to be quicker skill building assignments.</p>

<h4 id="projects-40">Projects (40%)</h4>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your ability to submit the required weekly work for the project. These weekly submissions use a simple rubric based on your effort, timeliness, and completion. The second grade will be based on the final project you submit and has a more extensive rubric. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 40%.</p>

<h3 id="technology-requirements">Technology Requirements</h3>

<p>Note that this course requires the use of Adobe Creative Cloud applications. With the suspension of in-person classes, CVPA computer labs will not be available to fulfill this requirement. If you do not already have an Adobe license and are interested in purchasing one or if you already have a license and need to renew it, please visit <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html">Adobe</a>. If you cannot afford an Adobe license, you may submit a request for funding to the Student Emergency Assistance Fund. Please visit the <a href="https://ulife.gmu.edu/student-emergency-assistance-funding-2-2-2/">Student Emergency Assistance Fund</a> to apply.</p>

<h3 id="visual-voices-lecture-series">Visual Voices Lecture Series</h3>

<p>Visual Voices is a year-long series of lectures by artists, art historians and others about contemporary art and art practice. Visual Voices lectures are held on four Thursday evenings from 7:20–9:00 p.m:</p>

<h3 id="artsbus">Artsbus</h3>

<p>Due to Covid, Fall 2020 dates for Artsbus have been canceled.</p>

<h3 id="students-with-disabilities-and-learning-differences">Students with Disabilities and Learning Differences</h3>

<p>If you have a diagnosed disability or learning difference and you need academic accommodations, please inform me at the beginning of the semester and contact the Disabilities Resource Center (SUB I room 234, 703-993-2474). You must provide me with a faculty contact sheet from that office outlining the accommodations needed for your disability or learning difference. All academic accommodations must be arranged in advance through the DRC.</p>

<h3 id="official-communications-via-mason-e-mail">Official Communications via Mason E-Mail</h3>

<p>Mason uses electronic mail to provide official information to students. Examples include communications from course instructors, notices from the library, notices about academic standing, financial aid information, class materials, assignments, questions, and instructor feedback. Students are responsible for the content of university communication sent to their Mason e-mail account, and are required to activate that account and check it regularly.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-policies">Attendance Policies</h3>

<p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of non-participation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor’s grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>

<p>Students in this class are bound by the Honor Code, as stated in the George Mason University Catalog. The honor code requires that the work you do as an individual be the product of your own individual synthesis or integration of ideas. (This does not prohibit collaborative work when it is approved by your instructor.) As a faculty member, I have an obligation to refer the names of students who may have violated the Honor Code to the Student Honor Council, which treats such cases very seriously. No grade is important enough to justify cheating, for which there are serious consequences that will follow you for the rest of your life. If you feel unusual pressure about your grade in this or any other course, please talk to me or to a member of the GMU Counseling Center staff.</p>

<p>Using someone else’s words or ideas without giving them credit is plagiarism, a very serious Honor Code offense. It is very important to understand how to prevent committing plagiarism when using material from a source. If you wish to quote verbatim, you must use the exact words and punctuation just as the passage appears in the original and must use quotation marks and page numbers in your citation. If you want to paraphrase or summarize ideas from a source, you must put the ideas into your own words, and you must cite the source, using the APA or MLA format. (For assistance with documentation, I recommend Diana Hacker, A Writer’s Reference.) The exception to this rule is information termed general knowledge—information that is widely known and stated in a number of sources. Determining what is general knowledge can be complicated, so the wise course is, “When in doubt, cite.”</p>

<p>Be especially careful when using the Internet for research. Not all Internet sources are equally reliable; some are just plain wrong. Also, since you can download text, it becomes very easy to inadvertently plagiarize. If you use an Internet source, you must cite the exact URL in your paper and include with it the last date that you successfully accessed the site.</p>

<h3 id="writing-center-and-library-resources">Writing Center and Library Resources</h3>

<p>Students who are in need of intensive help with grammar, structure or mechanics in their writing should make use of the services of Writing Center, located in Robinson A116 (703-993-1200). The services of the Writing Center are available by appointment, online and, occasionally, on a walk-in basis.</p>

<p>The Collaborative Learning Hub Located in Johnson Center 311 (703-993-3141), the lab offers in-person one-on-one support for the Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, Blackboard, and a variety of other software. Dual monitor PCs make the lab ideal for collaborating on group projects, Macs are also available; as well as a digital recording space, collaborative tables, and a SMART Board. Free workshops are also available (Adobe and Microsoft) through Training and Certification; visit <a href="ittraining.gmu.edu">ittraining.gmu.edu</a> to see the schedule of workshops and to sign up.</p>

<p>Provisions Research Center for Art &amp; Social Change is located in Room L001 of the Art &amp; Design Building. This student resource assists students in exploring and engaging new models for artmaking that lead to a more inclusive, equitable, and connected society. Provisions is also a hub for developing art projects through Mason Exhibitions, the Mural Brigade, and art partners throughout the metropolitan area, and beyond. Feel free to come in and browse the library, study, eat, etc. The University Art Librarian, Stephanie Grimm, will have regular hours in Provisions on Tuesdays at 2pm. Contact Don Russell for more information: drusse10@gmu.edu</p>

<h3 id="responsible-employee-disclosure">Responsible Employee Disclosure</h3>

<p>As a faculty member, I am designated as a “Responsible Employee,” and must report all disclosures of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and stalking to Mason’s Title IX Coordinator per University</p>

<p>Policy 1202. If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of Mason’s confidential resources, such as Student Support and Advocacy Center (SSAC) at 703-380-1434 or Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 703-993-2380. You may also seek assistance from Mason’s Title IX Coordinator by calling 703-993-8730, or emailing titleix@gmu.edu.</p>

<h3 id="commitment-to-diversity">Commitment to Diversity</h3>

<p>This class will be conducted as an intentionally inclusive community that celebrates diversity and welcomes the participation in the life of the university of faculty, staff and students who reflect the diversity of our plural society. All may feel free to speak and to be heard without fear that the content of the opinions they express will bias the evaluation of their academic performance or hinder their opportunities for participation in class activities. In turn, all are expected to be respectful of each other without regard to race, class, linguistic background, religion, political beliefs, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, veteran’s status, or physical ability.</p>

<h3 id="statement-on-ethics-in-teaching-and-practicing-art-and-design">Statement on Ethics in Teaching and Practicing Art and Design</h3>

<p>As professionals responsible for the education of undergraduate and graduate art and design students, the faculty of the School of Art adheres to the ethical standards and practices incorporated in the professional Code of Ethics of our national accreditation organization, The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).</p>

<p>Once the add and drop deadlines have passed, instructors do not have the authority to approve requests from students to add or drop/withdraw late. Requests for late adds (up until the last day of classes) must be made by the student in the School of Art office (or the office of the department offering the course), and generally are only approved in the case of a documented university error (such as a problem with financial aid being processed) , LATE ADD fee will apply. Requests for non-selective withdrawals and retroactive adds (adds after the last day of classes) must be approved by the academic dean of the college in which the student’s major is located. For AVT majors, that is the CVPA Office of Academic Affairs in College Hall.</p>
