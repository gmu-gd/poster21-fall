#### Exercise 6: Print with a Purpose
Pick a cause you feel passionate about and make a poster that you would carry at a rally for that cause. The design should be simple enough to be made from a cut paper stencil and have a clear message. It can have multiple layers but each layer will need to have a stencil so keep in mind the labor before committing to a complicated design.
While printing consider how color can affect the message. Can you combine your stencil with another stencil and create a new message? Make a total of 10 prints with at least 5 with only your design on them.


##### Technical Requirements
* 10 18&#8243;x24&#8243; prints
* Image of poster(s) added to Miro
